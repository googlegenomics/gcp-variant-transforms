# This is used by Google Cloud Build GitHub app, which automatically builds the
# code each time you push code to Github. This is what it does:
# * Builds an image using the GitHub commit hash as the tag.
# * Pushes that image to Container Registry.
# * Runs small integration tests (only one test included for now) from that very
#   image.

  # Note that ./deploy_and_run_tests.sh that is referenced here is coming from
  # the source downloaded from GitHub and not the file in the docker image.
  # The only reason that we use the built image in the 'name' argument is
  # convenience, i.e., to avoid installing python, virtualenv, etc. on the
  # image.
