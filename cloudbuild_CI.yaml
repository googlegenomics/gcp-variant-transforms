# This is meant to be used by the Build Triggers set in Container Builder Builds
# of a cloud project. This is what it does:
# * Builds an image using the last GitHub commit hash as the tag.
# * Pushes that image to Container Registry.
# * Runs the integration test from that very image.

steps:
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args:
      - 'build'
      - '--tag=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/gcp-variant-transforms:${COMMIT_SHA}'
      - '--file=docker/Dockerfile'
      - '.'
  # We have to push now since we are using this image in the next step.
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args:
      - 'push'
      - 'gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/gcp-variant-transforms:${COMMIT_SHA}'
  # Run the test script from the image we just built and pushed.
  #
  # Note that ./deploy_and_run_tests.sh that is referenced here is coming from
  # the source downloaded from GitHub and not the file in the docker image.
  # The only reason that we use the built image in the 'name' argument is
  # convenience, i.e., to avoid installing python, virtualenv, etc. on the
  # image.
