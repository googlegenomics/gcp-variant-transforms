# Sample Queries

This folder contains sample queries showing the functionality of querying a
dataset in BigQuery which was imported with Variant Transforms.

By providing these queries we are hoping researchers can better utilize their
BigQuery tables. Also this will provide a way for the community to contribute
by modifying these queries or suggesting new ones. We highly encourage all
users to send us their queries so we can share them here with all other
researchers. Please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/googlegenomics/gcp-variant-transforms/issues)
or contact us via our public mailing list
[gcp-life-sciences-discuss@googlegroups.com](mailto:gcp-life-sciences-discuss@googlegroups.com).

## Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)

The tutorial notebook can be opened in Colaboratory, a product from Google
Research which is a hosted notebook service requiring no setup. Alternatively,
the raw .ipynb notebook can be downloaded to open in your own Jupyter
environment.
