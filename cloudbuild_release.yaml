# This is meant to be used by the Build Trigger set in Cloud Build for auto
# release. This is what it does:
# - Builds an image using the last GitHub commit hash as the tag.
# - Pushes that image to the test project's Container Registry.
# - Runs all integration test from that very image.
# - Pushes the verified image to the main project (gcp-variant-transforms).
